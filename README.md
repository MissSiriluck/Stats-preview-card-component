## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

**em unit**

**CSS ::before Selector**
The ::before selector inserts something before the content of each selected element(s).
Use the content property to specify the content to insert.
**Ps.** I use this for image color overlay by CSS.

example as below:
```css
.img-container:before {
    content: "";
    background-color: ;
    display: ;
    position: ;
}
```

<!-- ```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
``` -->

### Continued development

- Redesign adding some interactive for this component.
- Coding by React, Vue, SCSS, boostrab or some other that you want to learn more.

### Useful resources
